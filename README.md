[![CI](https://github.com/DaisyOli/practice-br/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DaisyOli/practice-br/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An AI-powered platform where Portuguese language teachers create interactive exercises and students practice with instant, personalized feedback. Built for the professional-training market too: learners funded through France's OPCO / CPF schemes get tracked practice hours and printable training attestations.

Live in private beta at [app.practicebr.com](https://app.practicebr.com), with real teachers and students testing it. Built and shipped solo — from first commit to production on Heroku — as my first Rails project after the Le Wagon bootcamp, and evolved well beyond it since.

## What it does

**For teachers:**
- Create activities in minutes — or let AI do the heavy lifting:
  - **Generate a full activity from a text prompt** (statement, explanation and questions), powered by Claude — runs as a background job with a friendly animated wait screen, so the teacher is never stuck on a blocked request
  - **Generate an activity from a YouTube video**: the transcript is fetched and turned into comprehension questions
- Six exercise types: multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, open-ended, sentence ordering, paragraph ordering and column matching
- Review AI-generated drafts before publishing — the AI proposes, the teacher decides
- Invite students by email — each student is scoped to their teacher
- Dashboard with per-level (CEFR A1–C1) and per-competency breakdowns, pending corrections and student activity

**For students:**
- Practice activities filtered by level and competency — listening (CO), reading (CE) and writing (EE)
- Instant scoring with per-question feedback; multiple-choice alternatives are shuffled on every attempt to avoid position bias
- **Open-ended answers graded by AI**, with constructive feedback written in Portuguese — grading rigor scales with CEFR level, from lenient at A1 to demanding at C1
- **Answer by voice**: audio recordings are transcribed with Whisper
- Progress dashboard with competency tracking, search and activity ratings
- Installable as a PWA, with web push notifications for new activities

**For professionally-funded learners (OPCO / eCPF):**
- In France, language training is often paid for by professional-training funds — the employer's OPCO or the learner's personal training account (CPF). Funders require proof that the training actually happened, and being able to produce it is what lets a teacher take on funded students at all
- Teachers tag a student as OPCO or eCPF right on the invitation email; a dedicated badge then follows the student across the teacher's dashboard and the student's own profile
- One click generates a **printable training attestation** per student, with hours computed from tracked practice time — from opening an activity to submitting it — rather than self-reported

**Under the hood:**
- Trial-to-subscription onboarding with Stripe (checkout + webhooks)
- Weekly reminder emails (Resend + Heroku Scheduler) and daily YouTube video suggestions per teacher
- Interface localized in Portuguese, English and French

## Architecture notes

- **Service objects** keep controllers thin: quiz submission and AI grading, activity generation (prompt- and video-based), transcription, push notifications and analytics each live in their own service under `app/services`.
- **Both AI pipelines run in background jobs** (GoodJob, backed by Postgres — no Redis): activity generation and answer grading are queued instead of blocking the request, with retry + graceful degradation when the AI is unavailable, and the UI updates itself via a polling Stimulus controller instead of a page refresh.
- **Cost-aware model selection**: Claude Opus generates activities — low volume, quality-critical, guided by a grading rubric baked into the system prompt — while Claude Haiku grades student answers, which run at much higher volume. Same pipeline, different model for the economics of each job.
- **Server-rendered UI with Hotwire** — no SPA, no API layer to maintain; Turbo handles interactivity.
- **Role-based access** (admin / teacher / student / trial) enforced at controller level, with students scoped to the teacher who invited them.
- **Graceful degradation**: AI, YouTube and Unsplash integrations are optional — the platform works without their API keys.

## Technical roadmap

Things I know need work, in priority order:

- [x] Move AI grading calls out of the request cycle into background jobs (GoodJob + async UI updates)
- [x] Move AI activity generation out of the request cycle too (background job + async UI updates)
- [x] Finish migrating the remaining Bootstrap views to Tailwind/DaisyUI
- [x] Consolidate the repetitive `clear_*` controller actions into a single parameterized action
- [ ] Raise request-spec coverage on the billing and quiz-submission flows
- [ ] Extract multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank into their own models — right now they're fields on `Question`, unlike the other four exercise types, which each have their own model. Deliberately deferred: the quiz flow is the app's most critical path, so this waits for a dedicated, carefully planned sprint

## Running locally

**Prerequisites:** Ruby 3.3.5, PostgreSQL, Bundler, Yarn

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaisyOli/practice-br.git
cd practice-br

bundle install
yarn install

# Set up the database
bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

# Start the server + Tailwind watcher
bin/dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

**Environment variables** — create a `.env` file at the project root:

```
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
```

Optional keys unlock the integrations: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (AI generation and grading), `OPENAI_API_KEY` (voice answers), `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`.

## Running tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

The suite also runs on every push via GitHub Actions.
